/**
 * Where an interactive command reads its answers from.
 *
 * <p>Interactive code takes this rather than a {@link Console}, which is final and so cannot be
 * stood in for: a method that accepts a {@code Console} is reachable only by a human at a
 * keyboard, and that is how {@code isx init}'s credential flows shipped bugs no test could have
 * caught (#772). Production reads the terminal through {@link #of(Console)}; tests hand in
 * canned answers.
 *
 * <p>Both methods answer {@code null} at EOF, exactly as {@code Console} does, so every caller
 * keeps deciding for itself what running out of input means.
 *
 * <p>The question is shown here too ({@link #show}, {@link #ask}), with the lines said only
 * because one is asked ({@link #say}: its options, a re-ask), so what a flow asks and what it
 * reads live in one place, and a test sees both (#1703). The terminal's are shown through the
 * bound output ({@code BuildOutput.prompt}, a {@code step} for a said line), at its step
 * indent, so a question asked in a group sits in it. What a flow reports between questions is
 * not the conversation: it goes through {@code BuildOutput}.
