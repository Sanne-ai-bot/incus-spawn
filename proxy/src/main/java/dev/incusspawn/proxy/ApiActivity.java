/**
 * What each instance has asked of the Claude Messages API (#898): requests made and in flight,
 * when the last one started and ended, and the tokens their responses report, each instance's
 * counted from when its counters were created, which the snapshot says. Counters belong to one
 * incarnation of a name: an instance destroyed and branched again under it starts afresh (#1063). Served to the host only, on {@code /activity}, so {@code isx mcp} can tell
 * a working agent from a stuck or silently finished one without touching its instance.
 *
 * <p>Only model calls count as model calls -- Claude Code's other traffic to the same domain
 * (settings, telemetry) would make an idle agent look busy. All of an instance's traffic, model
 * calls included, is counted apart, by domain ({@link Flow}, #935), on the same counters, and
 * that of callers that are no known instance under {@code unattributed}. Counters are
 * observations, the only state of the proxy a restart loses: the snapshot says since when each counts.
