/**
 * Where isx's messages go: the one seam between the code that reports and whoever owns the
 * terminal (#1703). Code reports through {@link BuildOutput}'s static methods, which hand each
 * message to the bound output ({@link BuildOutput#bind}); the owner of the terminal binds once.
 * The CLI keeps the default, a {@link TerminalOutput}. The TUI binds {@link #diagnosticsTo} its
 * warning log while it draws and {@link #copying} it from a terminal it has released; {@code isx
 * mcp} binds a terminal on stderr alone, and the proxy its own log.
 *
 * <p>The vocabulary is what isx already prints. Progress (headers, groups, steps, live steps,
 * lists) and notes mean something only on a terminal, so an output that is not one ignores them by
 * default. Diagnostics never are: {@link #stepWarn}, {@link #warnBanner} and {@link #stepFail}
 * default to {@link #warn}, so an output that implements only that one method still receives
 * every warning and error.
