 * for other threads of this one.
 *
 * <p>The in-process lock is not optional. A second {@link FileChannel#tryLock} on a file this
 * process already locks throws rather than waits, and closing any channel on the file drops
 * every {@code fcntl} lock the process holds on it, so only one thread may have it open.
 *
 * <p>Not reentrant: acquiring a lock this thread already holds throws. Callers that nest share
 * the work through a variant that assumes the lock is held (see {@code VmManager}).
 *
 * <p>{@link #acquireShared} takes it shared instead: any number of shared holders, in this process
 * and others, but none while it is held exclusively. A process holds one shared {@code fcntl} lock
 * for all its shared holders, released with the last of them.
