/**
 * Registers {@code isx mcp} in the Claude Code of an instance branched with
 * {@code --mcp-client}, and takes it out of every other (#1182).
 *
 * <p>Reconciled from the {@link Metadata#MCP_CALLER} stamp on every isx start, by the exec that
 * already delivers the per-start secret ({@link InstanceSecret#GUEST_SCRIPT}): the host says
 * whether the instance holds the grant ({@link #ENV}), and a marker in the rootfs says whether
 * isx registered the server there before. Only on a mismatch does the script run Claude Code's
 * own {@code claude mcp add-json} or {@code claude mcp remove} (user scope), so a steady-state
 * start costs one file test. A copy of a coordinator carries the registration and the marker
 * until its first isx start, which removes both: no copy carries the stamp.
 *
 * <p>The registration is not the capability. The proxy decides who reaches the server by
 * address, per-start secret and stamp, so a registration left behind, or one a user adds by
 * hand, reaches nothing an instance without the stamp could not.
 *
 * <p>Root runs the script, and {@code claude} lives in the agent's home, where the agent can
 * replace it: it only ever runs as the agent, never as root. The marker is root's, so nothing
 * in the guest but this script decides what isx believes it registered.
